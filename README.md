spatialbranchr implements a spatially explicit branching process
framework. Briefly, spatialbranchr can 

1. jointly estimate relative movement between locations and the reproduction numbers in these
locations given incidence time-series; 

2. jointly estimate reporduction
numbers in multiple locations using a spatially epxlicit branching
process given time-series of incidence and information on movement;

3. project incidence under this framework. 

The methodology is available [here](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41746-021-00442-3).
