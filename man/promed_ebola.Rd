\description{
This data set gives the daily incidence of
Ebola cases (includes suspected and confirmed cases)
for each country in Africa. Note that most of the
countries did not experience any Ebola cases in
this epidemic. The '0s' have been filled in
for convenience. The raw data were colleced by
ProMED and the pre-processing pipeline has been
described in detail elsewhere (See linked paper).
