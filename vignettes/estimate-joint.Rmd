We will data from the West African Ebola epidemic to jointly estimate
the effective reproduction number and two parameters of the gravity
model capturing human population movement - (a) pstay, which characterises the probability that an
infectious individual will not move out of a spatial unit (here
country) during their infectious period, and (b) gamma, which
modulates the effect of the distance between two spatial units on the
flow of populations between them.
